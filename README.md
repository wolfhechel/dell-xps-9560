# Dell XPS 9560 configuration 


This is my base configuration for Arch Linux, heavily focused on low power
consumption.

More or less all of these configurations are bits and pieces gathered from
various sources on the internet which I try to attribute as often as possible
and most are tried out with trial and error. Haven't measured the power
consumption impact with powertop or anything, it's just my gut feeling sort of.

A lot of focus and time has been spent on trying to understand everything that
is changed, and the consequences of each alteration. I strongly suggest against
applying fixes without understanding them. It makes troubleshooting a hell.
